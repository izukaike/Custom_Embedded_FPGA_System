# Custom Embedded FPGA System
Assembler, UART, 64-Bit ARM Processor, Memory Controller

As a computer engineering student I wanted to follow my curiosity and get more hardware experience diving into the details of digital design. I am building an assembler, processor, and memory interface in C++, Python, and SystemVerilog. As I dive deeper and get more interested in hardware design inspired by my Computer Organization and Advanced Digital Logic classs at Baylor University, I want to apply my knowledge and enjoy every step. I think that a 64-bit RISC design is important in many hardware engineering applications and so I think it is the way to go. Here is my journey!
